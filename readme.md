# ~~Conformer-Numpy~~ Conformer-Torch

This on-going project implements Conformer model with ~~numpy~~ pytorch at an operator level. It aims to assist in making the hardware implementation of the inference of this model by  
- Enhance my understanding of this model
- Generate intermediate input / output for unit testing of each hardware block
